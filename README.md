### Hatgoos Tutorial
Author of this mod is DaNike#6223

This mod allows you to have your goose wear hats it can also be run with other mods

<br/>
• First download the hatgoos mod

The file should say "hatgoos_with_loader.zip" when you download it

• Make sure to load it in the same area as the DesktopGoose.exe to unzip it should something like this

<br/>
• Delete the config file

• Then run the 'run with mods.bat' that you see above

• Then exit that program

• Open up the newly created config file

This is what you should kinda see (or something similar, as long it has the last 4 lines the same on that notepad)

<br/>
• Edit 
HatGoos.HatMode=Default

• To this
HatGoos.HatMode=Custom

<br/>
• Last but not least copy the location of the hat you want which you can do by clicking the search bar of your file manager and copying it.

See here:

Note: Don't forget to include the name of the image file

• Paste it in HatGoos.CustomHatPath= 

<br/>
So it should look more like this

Example:
HatGoos.CustomHatPath=C:\Users\user\Downloads\PC\Desktop Goose\Assets\Images\Hats\hat5.png

<br/>
• Remember to save the Config file's changes

• Run the 'run with mods.bat' file once more and you're done!

<br/>
**Note:** If you run the DesktopGoose.exe you will end up corrupting the file so take caution of that. Also it can take a while for the goose to show up if you are using other mods. You can still press esc to exit the program. You should be running with 'run with mods.bat' from that point on, everytime. If you don't want hats then change HatGoos.HatMode= to HatGoos.HatMode=None in the Config file.
