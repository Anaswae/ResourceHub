### Sneaky Goose Tutorial with Visuals

The goose will try to grab your mouse very slowly. The goose will get away with it, also slowly.

* First download the mod (It should be called Sneaky Goose.zip)

* Then extract the file. (A folder will appear, click on it.)

![You should see the following files appear inside the Sneaky Goose folder: Assets, Config, and Goose Desktop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DesktopGooseUnofficial/ResourceHub-Images/master/Sneaky%20Goose/part%201.png "You should see the following files appear inside the Sneaky Goose folder: Assets, Config, and Goose Desktop")

* You can run the GooseDesktop.exe and that's it
