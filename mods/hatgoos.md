• Delete the config file

• Then run the 'run with mods.bat' that you see above

• Then exit that program

• Open up the newly created config file

What you should see the last 4 lines the same on that notepad (Do not worry about the other configuration settings on that notepad):
![HatGoos.HatMode=Default, HatGoos.HorizontalSize=1.5, HatGoos.HatPosition=0.6, and HatGoos.CustomHatPath=](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672263146240737280/673283260335521812/unknown.png "The last 4 line is what should show on your notepad")

• Edit this part:
HatGoos.HatMode=Default

• To this:
HatGoos.HatMode=Custom

• Last but not least copy the location of the hat you want which you can do by clicking the search bar of your file manager and copying it.

See here:

Note: Don't forget to include the name of the image file

• Paste it in HatGoos.CustomHatPath= 

So it should look more like this

Example:
HatGoos.CustomHatPath=C:\Users\user\Downloads\PC\Desktop Goose\Assets\Images\Hats\hat5.png

• Remember to save the Config file's changes

• Run the 'run with mods.bat' file once more and you're done!

**Note:** If you run the DesktopGoose.exe you will end up corrupting the file. You should be running with 'run with mods.bat' everytime. Also it can take a while for the goose to show up if you are using other mods. You can still press esc to exit the program. If you don't want hats then change HatGoos.HatMode= to HatGoos.HatMode=None in the Config file. If the file does get corruptted, delete the config file and make new one using the 'run with mods.bat' again. Otherwise you may have to startover.
