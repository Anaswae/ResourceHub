### Shaggy's Sound Control Tutorial with Visuals
You can turn off things like the sound of its honk, mud splash, bite, and its tapping feet.

* First download the mod it should be called GooseSoundControl.zip

* Then extract the file. (A folder will appear, click on it.)

![You should see the following files appear inside the GooseSoundControl Folder: Assets, Changelog, Config, and Goose Desktop](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672263146240737280/673642920208891904/unknown.png "You should see the following files appear inside the GooseSoundControl Folder: Assets, Changelog, Config, and Goose Desktop")

* Open the config file in Notepad (there should be 4 lines that affect the sounds)

![There are 4 lines in that notepad that says: WalkSound=True, HonkSound=True, BiteSound=True, and MudSquish=True](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672554163925942328/673635780190535700/unknown.png "Notice the 4 lines in that notepad that says: WalkSound=True, HonkSound=True, BiteSound=True, and MudSquish=True")
