| Minecraft                | ✔️❌ | Multiplayer is discouraged, some people have got it to grab the mouse and move the camera causing what most call a "tornado" which admins could ban for. Singleplayer is fine though. |
| Overwatch                | ✔️    |                                                                                                  |
| Rainbow 6 Siege / Any other games using BattlEye          | ❌    | You WILL get banned if he grabs your mouse, any other games that use BattlEye will most likely ban players using Desktop Goose. |
| Roblox                   | ✔️❌  | The "tornado" effect would most likely happen in first person. Some games may have admin tools to ban people. |
| Runescape 2              | ❓     |  
| Space Engineers          | ✔️❌  | It CAN and WILL make you crash your ship.|
| Team Fortress 2          | ✔️    | It can move your mouse and will mess with the camera so you may get banned on some servers due to admins, VAC hasn't banned anyone for it yet |
| Terraria                 | ✔️    |                                                                                                  |
| World of Warcraft        | ✔️    |
| Garry's Mod| ✔️❌| Memes cover a lot of the spawnmenu, and the goose CAN move the camera. Some servers may not care but some will, keep that in mind.                                                                                                 |
